    <p> Preah Sihanouk is a province located in southwest Cambodia, on the Gulf of Thailand. The provincial capital, also called Sihanoukville, is a coastal city and a popular tourist destination known for its beautiful beaches, tropical islands, and vibrant nightlife. The province is named after King Norodom Sihanouk, the former king of Cambodia [10].

        The province has a population of around 229,205 people, with a mix of Khmer, Vietnamese, Chinese, Cham, Thai, Korean, French, British, Europeans, Australians, and Americans living in the urban area [2].
        
        Sihanoukville city has a string of beaches along its entire coastline and coastal marshlands bordering Ream National Park in the east. The city has one navigable river, the mangrove-lined Ou Trojak Jet, running from Otres Pagoda to the sea at Otres. Several thinly inhabited islands, under Sihanoukville's administration, are near the city [2].
        
        The city has evolved parallel to the construction of the Sihanoukville Autonomous Port, which commenced in June 1955, as the country's gateway to direct and unrestricted international sea trade. The only deep-water port in Cambodia includes an oil terminal and a transport logistics facility [2].
        
        The official name of the city in Khmer is: krong ('city'), preah ('holy') Sihanouk (name of the former king), which adds up to: "City of the Holy Sihanouk" or "Honorable Sihanouk City" [2].
        
        The alternative name, Kompong Saom (also romanized as Kompong Som and Kampong Som), (Khmer: កំពង់សោម) means 'Port of the Moon' or 'Shiva's Port' [2].
        
        The city has a relatively high Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.750, compared to the national average HDI of 0.523 [2].
