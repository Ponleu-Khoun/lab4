        Kratié’s forests, less dense and more open than elsewhere in Cambodia, primarily consist of deciduous trees shedding their leaves during the dry season.
        
        The Mekong River traverses the province from north to south, covering approximately 140 km of its expanse. Known for its biodiversity, the river is home to Irrawaddy dolphins, various fish species, and a plethora of avian life. The flow of the Mekong River in Kratié town experiences significant variation. The area is characterized by numerous seasonally flooded islands, and plans were underway in 2007 by the Cambodian government to construct a dam near Kratié town. Additionally, the province boasts lush forests, the Phnom Pram Poan mountain range, Phnom Prech, and extensive rubber plantations. Eastern Kratié serves as an important bird habitat.
