    <h1>Welcome to  Battanbang Province</h1>

    <p>Battambang might lack the notoriety of Cambodian cities like Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, but it’s a very worthwhile addition to any Southeast Asian travel itinerary.

        The city was founded all the way back in the eleventh century, and, since then, it’s remained the hub of the northwestern Cambodia. Battambang is as well-known for what’s in the city as in the surrounding region, but I wouldn’t sleep on what the urban centre offers, either. I remember arriving in the city and being taken aback by how well preserved the French colonial architecture is, but also how that intersected with Khmer architecture.
        
        What I loved about Battambang is that it wasn’t a hard place to get to know well. It’s a large city by the standards of the country, but it isn’t overwhelming, and that lends itself to both an intimate and manageable visit. You don’t need to spend a long time in Battambang to get a feel for the city.
