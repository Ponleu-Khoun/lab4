    <p>The area of Kampong Thom held an important position in early Khmer History (Pre-Angkor Period) from the late Funan (68 to 550 A.D.) to Chenla (550 to 802 A.D.) period, some of the earliest known civilizations in Southeast Asia. Chenla or Zenla was a former vassal of the Funan Kingdom (Norkor Phnom or the Mountain Kingdom). Later, Chenla progressively gained its supremacy and ultimately proclaimed its independence from having conquered the Funan Kingdom by King Citrasena Mahendravarman in the late 6th century. Historically, the area near the Stung Saen river was the ancient capital to Chenla or Zenla Kingdom roughly in the late 6th century to the early 7th century, called Isanapura or Sambor Prei Kuk, and is noted for its unique architectural style that predates the Angkorian period. The name Isanapura, literally means “Isana Castle”, also appears in Chinese Historical Literature such as The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, a travel and topographical records by a Tang Buddhist monk called Xuanzangs, contains indication of Isanapura as one of the six South Sea states signifying that the affluence of Chenla or Zenla Empire extended to foreign countries, and the Book of Sui holds a predominantly descriptive passage and provides an early record of Isanapura in the first half of the 7th century. Chinese historical records dealing with Isanapura, Book of Sui, gives more detailed description of the city that there were about 20,000 houses located in and around the city, by way of explanation, an expected population of nearly 100,000 in the early 7th century. During the height of the Khmer Empire (9th to 15th centuries), Kampong Thom continued to be an important region. It was strategically located along the ancient royal road connecting the Angkor capital with other significant provincial centers.
