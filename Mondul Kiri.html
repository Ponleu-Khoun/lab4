    <h1> Mondul Kiri</h1>

    <h3> History</h3>
    <p> In 1960 Mondulkiri was created out of Krati√© province by order of King Norodom Sihanouk. Saen Monorom was set up as the capital in 1962. During the Vietnam War in the late 1960s, Mondulkiri was home to three bases of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam which resulted in numerous incursions and bombings by US forces. About 1970 the area fell under Khmer Rouge domination. Subsequently, much of the populace was forcibly removed to Koh Nhek (Kaoh Nheaek) district to provide labor for rice farming. Schools, hospitals and even entire villages were destroyed. As many as half of the people in the province died during the forced relocation in the 1970s.

        The Bunong people appear to have lived in the provincial area for about 2000 years, but there is little documentation until France colonized Cambodia in 1864. Like other people in the province, the Bunong were displaced in the 1970s and only allowed to return to their traditional homeland in the 1980s.

    <h3> About  Mondulkiri</h3>
    <p> lthough more and more houses are built in 'Khmer style', traditional Bunong houses can still be found. Bunong houses contain large jars (which are said to be more than a thousand years old) and traditional gongs. There are various gongs used at different occasions. Jars and gongs are among the most valuable possessions of indigenous communities both in traditional and spiritual as well as material terms. In the 1970s, during the regime of the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot those objects were buried in hidden places in the jungle and in many cases still remain unfound.
